## Introduction
The Philosophers proyect introduces the basics of threading a process and discover the mutex through a version of the dining philosopher problem.
This version of the dining philosopher problem states that *k* philosophers are seated at a round table either eating spaghetti, sleeping or thinking (once at a time). The table is set so there's a fork/chopstick for every philosopher (i.e. k forks). In order to start eating, they will need 2 forks, one for each hand. Each time a philosopher finishes eating, they will drop their forks and start sleeping. Once they have finished sleeping, they will start thinking.
The simulation stops when then philosophers have eaten a certain amount of time or when a philosopher dies, i.e. when the philo starves.

## New concept
*What is a thread?* 
A thread, known as a lightweight process, is a path of execution within a process, with its own program counter that keeps track of which instruction to execute next, system registers which hold its current working variables, and a stack which contains the execution history.

Threads within the same process run in a shared memory space, while processes run in separate memory spaces. So if one thread alters a code segment memory item, all other threads see that.

*What is mutex?* 
Mutex in a binary variable
